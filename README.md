# Maximise_placesearch_algo
It is an algorithm designed by me to bring out the maximum number of places searched within an area, Using google places api.

To run this algorithm get your google maps api key and paste it in <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=Your_api_key&callback=initMap&libraries=places"
    async defer></script>
replace Your_api_key, in all the pages and get the results in console by executing set1() function in the console.
